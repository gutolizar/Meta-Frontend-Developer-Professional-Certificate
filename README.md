Some content from the Meta Frontend Developer Professional certificate throughout all the courses.
Each insertion here will have a HASH "#" and a number related to the specific course within the certification courses.

#1 - Introduction to frontend development discussing webapps, webpages and websites. DOM, WAI and W3C, an into to html and css with some class selectors. 
pseudo-class, box model, libraries and frameworks starting by bootstrap introduction. 
Respondive design, breakpoint, fixed grid and fluid grid, bootstrap infixes, modifiers, grid system.
Web server and application server and how they relate. SPA bundling and lazy loading. 
Introduction to React. How it deals with DOM and virtualDOM, component hierarchy, dynamic charts that renders <canvas> instead of HTML.

#2 - Programming with JavaScript - Started by an introduction to JS that can be used both in front and back-en these days. 
Data types, operators, conditional statements IF, ELSE, ELSE IF(that is almost like in C or Python which i've seen before). Looping constructs whit FOR, WHILE and NESTED loops. Then Function, its parameters, data storing in arrays then we end up in a introduction to OBJECTS. 
In Objects, which is the core of this course i think, i saw DOT NOTATION, BRACKETS NOTATION, the fact that arrays are Objects and its usage with PUSH() and POP(). 
Some math object and cheat sheet with some constants, rounding methods, arithmetic, calculus and random.
A closer look into strings with CONCATENATE and then OBJECT METHODS, typeOf operator and finally Error Handling. 
In Error Handling i got to see TRY and CATCH statement, THROW, and how to use it to solve problems with syntax, logical and all the other common errors.

#the upcoming courses which is inside the full certificate i'll update in due time.
